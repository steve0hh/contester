Hosted on [surge](https://contester.surge.sh/)

*This project was only tested on chrome browsers*

## What is this

This is a pure static site that uses the facebook graph api that allows users to download facebook likes and comment data via CSV. Users can subsequently use excel to open the files and random pick the winners for the contests.

## Framework and libraries used

- [vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [CSVjs](https://github.com/knrz/CSV.js/)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

I've written this project in static HTML, CSS and JS to save on server costs. :)
